         Packt is one of the most prolific and fast-growing tech book
         publishers in the world. Originally focused on open source
         software, Packt pays a royalty on relevant books directly
         to open source projects. These projects have received over
         $400,000 as part of Packt's Open Source Royalty Scheme
         to date.

         Our books focus on practicality, recognising that readers
         are ultimately concerned with getting the job done.
         Packt's digitally-focused business model allows us to
         publish up-to-date books in very specific areas. With
         over 1000 books published, Packt now offers a subscription
         service. This app and a PacktLib subscription now makes
         finding the information you need easier than ever before.
         PacktLib is Packt's online digital book library. Launched
         in August 2010, it allows you to access and search almost
         100,000 pages of book content, to find the solutions you
         need. As part of the Open Source community, Packt aims to
         help sustain the projects which it publishes books on.
         18When we sell a book written on an Open Source project, we
         pay a royalty to that project. Open Source projects have
         received over $400,000 through this scheme to date.
